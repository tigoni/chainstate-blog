The inputs are locked to a pubkey and only the owner of the pubkey can sign the transaction with a corresponding private key in order to unlock those outputs (spending). Cardano uses the eUTXO model which extends UTXO by making it possible for the pubkeys that lock outputs to be replaced with small scripts called validators. The validator is deployed as actual script address and lives on the blockchain as an output. An extra piece of data can be added to a validator and provides the convinience of have extra data in an output without having to modify the validator. This data is referred to as Datum.

<p>When it comes to how widely blockchain technology can be applied to a range of use-cases, it somehow depends on the model a blockchain uses for defining how transactions are settled.
Bitcoin uses a UTXO model on its ledger. This means that transactions are represented as a series of inputs and outputs that live on the blockchain. The inputs are locked to a pubkey and only the owner of the pubkey can sign the transaction with a corresponding private key in order to unlock those outputs (spending).
