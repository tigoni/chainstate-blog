<p>Two roads diverged in a wood,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
and I— I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost</p>

<p>I think that would sum up my journey in Cardano and Haskell in general because indeed it had made all the difference in my understanding of software engineering and quality.
I am a software developer from Nairobi, Kenya and when I am not working on software projects at The Africa Blockchain Center, I am likely reading about some blockchain related project.</p>
<p>I have been in software development for around seven years and have worked with languages and tools such as Java, JS, Golang, React, Node and most currently Haskell, thanks to the Cardano blockchain. My entry in the blockchain an crypto world goes back to around 2015 when I first heard of Bitcoin and just got some out of curiosity.</p>
<p>For a while my interest faded and it wasnt&rsquo; until two years later that I came back, thanks to the 2017 bull-run. This time I ordered Andreas&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Mastering Bitcoin&rsquo; and really got started delving into the technology. Later on, in 2019, I chanced apon Charles Hoskinson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Whiteboard Series&rsquo; on Youtube and the long short is that I got into Cardano and it has since been my main interest in the crypto and larger blockchain world.</p>
<p>Until recently, I was a back-end developer and moved on to fully focus on blockchain technology, mainly Cardano. In my typical day&rsquo;s work, I write software interfacing with the Cardano blockchain and also run a software development consultancy as ChainState Labs.</p>
<p>This blog is really a way to share some of the knowledge I think may help the community. My hope is that as I share, I get to learn more. I also opine on more general and local topics on Substack. You can contact me though either of the social media handles below.</p>
